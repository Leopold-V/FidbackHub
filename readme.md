# FidbackHub

**Todo: Write complete documentation**

Fidbackhub is a feedback management tools.
This is a passion and hobby project inspired by already existing application such as ![marker.io](https://marker.io/) and ![usersnap](https://usersnap.com/).
The core difference between them and Fidbackhub is that it is opensource, and as far as I have looked out, I haven't found any existing opensources alternatives to those tools.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript)
- Backend: Strapi (Headless CMS)
- Widget: Vite + react.js
- Using Docker to bootstrap an sql database while the application is in his early development, I aim to dockerize every part of the application in the future.
